 **Digital Image Processing Assignments**

This repository contains my weekly **Digital Image Processing (DIP)** assignments.  
Each assignment is organized into a separate folder with relevant code, input images, output results, and explanations.

The purpose of this repository is to maintain clean, well-structured, and version-controlled coursework as I progress through the DIP subject.
