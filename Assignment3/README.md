Assignment 3 – Image Negative & Contrast Stretching

This assignment focuses on pixel-wise intensity transformations in images:

🔹 Image Negative

Inverts grayscale pixel values

Useful for highlighting dark regions in X-ray or medical images

🔹 Contrast Stretching

Enhances the contrast of an image

Uses piecewise linear transformation function

Helps in better visualization of details in low-contrast images

🔹 Plotting Contrast Stretching Transfer Function

Shows mapping of input pixel intensity r to output intensity s

Useful for understanding how contrast is adjusted
