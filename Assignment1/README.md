This assignment covers three fundamental image resizing techniques used in Digital Image Processing:
**Nearest Neighbor Interpolation**
- Simplest scaling method  
- Fast but may produce blocky results  

**Bilinear Interpolation**
- Considers the nearest 4 pixels  
- Produces smoother results compared to nearest neighbor  

**Bicubic Interpolation**
- Considers 16 neighboring pixels  
- Produces the highest-quality scaling with smooth edges
